# Consumer Data Right Sandbox
The [Sandbox](https://cdrsandbox.gov.au/) is a hosted version of the [CDR Mock Solutions](https://github.com/ConsumerDataRight) that has been provided by the ACCC as a development tool to assist participants in the design, development, and testing of their CDR solutions in a non-production environment.

Signing up as a Sandbox participant allows you to register your test solutions and/or interact with the Sandbox hosted CDR Mock Solutions. You can also discover other Sandbox participants' test CDR solutions and organise interactions between the test CDR solutions.

The [Sandbox](https://cdrsandbox.gov.au/) is provided free of any charge to any Sandbox participant on a complimentary basis as part of the ACCC's role and responsibilities in relation to CDR. It is not provided on a commercial basis.

# Logging issues and requests
The Sandbox repository provides a public space for Sandbox Participants to log issues and requests. We welcome all Sandbox participants to use this site and post replies wherever they would like to contribute.

Visit the [issue tab](https://github.com/ConsumerDataRight/sandbox/issues) to log an issue or request. Select `Bug Report` or `Feature Request` depending on the nature of the issue.

If you would like to reach out to us by other means, please contact our Technical Operations Team via [CDRTechnicalOperations@accc.gov.au](mailto:cdrtechnicaloperations@accc.gov.au?subject=CDR%20Sandbox%20Issue).

# Code of Conduct
This project has adopted the **Contributor Covenant**.  For more information see the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# Notes
The CDR Sandbox is provided as a development tool and is not an exact replica of CDR production.
It conforms to the Consumer Data Standards, however there may be slight differences due to infrastructure and technology stack variances with production CDR.
